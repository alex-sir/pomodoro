## What is the Pomodoro Technique

The [*Pomodoro Technique*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a method to manage time through work and break intervals. Traditionally, the timer goes through four intervals of work (25 minutes) and breaks (5 minutes) with the last break being longer, usually around 15 minutes. One pomodoro equals one complete session. After four pomodoros are complete the long break starts, and then the timer restarts to the beginning with no pomodoros complete. Its purpose is to build discipline by enforcing sessions of work with no distractions and breaks to let the mind relax for a short amount of time before continuing with work.
